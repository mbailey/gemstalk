GemStalk
========

GemStalk is a CLI to the GemStalker rubygem release notification service.

It currently doesn't do anything more than print a message in green text.


Installation
============

Bearing in mind that it doesn't currently do much, installing it is breeze.

    $ sudo gem install gemstalk

If that didn't work then it's 99.9% likely you have a problem with your system.
By 'problem with your system' I mean you probably don't have Ruby or Rubygems 
installed correctly.


Usage
=====

I hope your expectations have been suitably lowered, for as I said before, it
doesn't really do anything yet. Awe, don't look at me like that - you're 
obviously deriving some form of enjoyment from the project if you've read this 
far. It doesn't have to all be about the money shot when you finally run the
program does it?

    $ gemstalk
